# 🎨 WordPress Theme Demonstration

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is **not** a full WordPress theme. It is designed solely to showcase my skills in **project architecture** and **code organization**.

## ✨ Key Strengths

- **Well-structured code** for maintainability and scalability.
- **Professional CSS** using the **BEM methodology**.
- **High performance** following WordPress best practices.
- **Easy future maintenance** due to clean architecture.
- **Dark Mode** feature available! 🌓 (Toggle button at the **bottom left corner** of the page).

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only the homepage is functional.
- Optimized for **desktop version only**.
